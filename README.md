I made a page to be displayed on a TV at school. 
It also has functionality to be used as a mobile page with responsive design that shows the students schedules when you press the text.

It's written in just JS and HTML/CSS and it uses mostly if/else statements to get the job done. 

It's still buggy as hell but im working it out.
